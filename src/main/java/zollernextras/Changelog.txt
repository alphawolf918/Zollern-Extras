[Zollern Extras - Initial Migration - to 1.11.2 - v1.0.0]

* Most things are being ported over. Some stuff may have to be left behind to make way for new things and new
  functionality. This will be a slow, grueling process, but it will be well worth it. I thank everyone for
  their continued patience.

* Changes:
    * Revamped some block textures.
    * Nether and Ender ore gen should now be more fluid (and natural).
    * Super Charged Coal now cooks much less items than it used to.
        * It cooks 16 items now (it used to be 512), as opposed to the 8 of regular coal.
            * Super Charged Coal Blocks cook 9x this.
        * It's a painful nerf, but a necessary one. It was too common and it just made things too easy.
    * Azurite Ore now requires Obsidian blocks to spawn, so there's considerably less of it.
        * Obsidian veins now spawn in all three dimensions by default.
            * When the Upside-Down is added, it will spawn there too.
        * Azurite Ore is one of only three ores to use the same Variant in all dimensions.
            * The only others are Zollernium Ore and Witherite Ore.
