* Enchantment on a pickaxe to reduce explosion chance on Nether Ores.

================================================================================
--BELOW IDEAS ARE FROM 1.7.10. THESE ARE NOT 100% IMPLEMENTED YET IN 1.11.2.--
================================================================================

* Add new horse armor: Emerald & Amaranth. (?)
    * Work with Zane and figure out how to make them render.
* Zinc Armor and Tools.
    * Add Enchantments to Zinc tools.
* Create tools and armor for amber, topaz, garnet, ruby, sapphire, opal, and aquamarine gems.
    * Maybe do the same thing for Witherium too.
* Lilypad Plants.
    * Have a way to grow Lilypads.
* Potion-infused arrows.
* More achievements.
* More potions.
* More golems.
* Growable animals.
* Perhaps make a new dimension called Elsewhere.
    * May create it as a separate mod.
* Add "information" about every necessary item in the mod.
    * This will help players understand how to progress.
* Store extended player data using JSON files.
    * Superpowers?
* 

==== CONFIG OPTIONS ====
* Add a configurable option to turn off Mega Creeper explosions. [D/D]
    * They could still hurt the Player, but not the terrain. [D/D]
========================

== ENDER STUFF ===================
[Ideas for how to revamp The End.]
==================================
* Find a way to make The End terrain bigger.
    * Perhaps use a structure gen for End Stone to increase its land.
    * Find out if there is a way to "stretch" or otherwise "increase" The End size.
* Fix the stupid Ender Creeper.
* Fix the stupid Ender Spider.
* 

====== UPSIDE-DOWN =======
[Ideas for the dimension.]
==========================
* Add a Corruption layer (layers 32 and below). [D]
    * All "Corrupt" blocks would extend parent corrupt blocks. [D]
    * Corrupt blocks would cause damage to the Player unless they have a specific item in their inventory.
    * Corruption blocks would have the chance to corrupt other blocks around them, regardless of what they are.
        * Corrupt Stone would turn anything else into Corrupt Stone, same for Corrupt Grass, etc.
    * Special mobs would spawn on and only on this specific layer.
    * Liquid Corruption could take the place of lava.
    * Make an upgraded version of Radium that protects against Corruption.
        * Enchantment?
        * Potion Effect? (Radiance 3+)
            * Could be obtained from upgraded Radium.
        * Etrium.
* Maybe find a way to add multiple biomes into the Upside-Down. [X/D]
* Replace Bedrock block with a special Upside-Down variant. [D/D]
    * Flatten the Bedrock layer. [D/D]
