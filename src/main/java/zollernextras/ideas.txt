* Add new horse armor: Emerald & Amaranth. (?)
    * Work with Jon and figure out how to make them render.
* Hell Ducks.
    * Have them make a "Quack" sound, similar to how Hellcows make a "moo" sound.
* Zinc Armor and Tools.
* Add Enchantments to Zinc tools.
* Create tools and armor for amber, topaz, garnet, ruby, sapphire, opal, and aquamarine gems.
    * Maybe do the same thing for Witherium too.
* Helletons.
    * Nether Skeletons that use the Enderman model but behave like Skeletons.

== ENDER STUFF ===================
[Ideas for how to revamp The End.]
==================================

* Ender Spider.
    * Behave the same way the Enderman does.
* Find a way to make The End terrain bigger.
    * Perhaps use a structure gen for End Stone to increase its land.
    * Find out if there is a way to "stretch" or otherwise "increase" The End size.

== UPSIDE DOWN ===========
[Ideas for the dimension.]
==========================

* Eggs that spawn Spiderlings when broken.
    * Spiderlings can then lay more eggs.
