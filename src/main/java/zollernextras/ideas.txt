* Add new horse armor: Emerald & Amaranth. (?)
    * Work with Zane and figure out how to make them render.
* Zinc Armor and Tools.
    * Add Enchantments to Zinc tools.
* Create tools and armor for amber, topaz, garnet, ruby, sapphire, opal, and aquamarine gems.
    * Maybe do the same thing for Witherium too.
* Lilypad Plants.
    * Have a way to grow Lilypads.
* Potion-infused arrows.
* More achievements.
* More potions.
* More golems.
* Growable animals.
* Add a configurable option to turn off Mega Creeper explosions.
    * They could still hurt the Player, but not the terrain.

== ENDER STUFF ===================
[Ideas for how to revamp The End.]
==================================

* Find a way to make The End terrain bigger.
    * Perhaps use a structure gen for End Stone to increase its land.
    * Find out if there is a way to "stretch" or otherwise "increase" The End size.
* Fix the stupid Ender Creeper.
* Fix the stupid Ender Spider.

== UPSIDE DOWN ===========
[Ideas for the dimension.]
==========================

* Add a Corruption layer.
    * All "Corrupt" blocks would extend parent corrupt blocks.
    * Corrupt blocks would cause damage to the Player unless they have a specific item in their inventory.
    * Corruption blocks would have the chance to corrupt other blocks around them, regardless of what they are.
        * Corrupt Stone would turn anything else into Corrupt Stone, same for Corrupt Grass, etc.
    * Special mobs would spawn on and only on this specific layer.
    * Liquid Corruption could take the place of lava.
